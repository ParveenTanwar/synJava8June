Lab 1 - Demo1 Project 
  Lab1 class -> create a new class to create an instance of thread by passing runnable
                create a helper class to implement runnable
                  Check number of lines of code
                  
                Replace runnable instance creation with lambda expression
                  Runnable r = () -> {
			            		};
                Reduce further for single liner
                  Runnable r = ()->...;
